# 🛡️ Full Linux SOC Monitoring Lab Guide
## Ubuntu SOC Server Investigating RHEL Victim (No SIEM)

---

# 📌 Project Purpose
This lab simulates a full cyber attack lifecycle against a RHEL endpoint monitored by an Ubuntu-based SOC workstation.  
The project demonstrates manual threat detection using native Linux logs and investigative tools without SIEM platforms.

# 🧱 Lab Architecture

| Role | Operating System | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| SOC Server | Ubuntu | Monitoring & Investigation |
| Victim Host | RHEL | Simulated Enterprise Endpoint |

## ✅ Step 1 — Configure Network

Set both VMs to same network:
- NAT Network OR Host-Only Network

---

## ✅ Step 2 — Verify IP Addresses

### Ubuntu SOC Server
```bash
ip a


### Screenshot 1: VMware Environment Setup

![VMware Environment](images/1.png) (images/2.png)

**What is shown:**  
VMware interface displaying two Linux virtual machines configured for the lab environment.
A Target machine & a SOC.Server machine to monitor the Target machine.

**Why this matters:**  
This establishes a controlled, isolated cybersecurity lab using VMware, a virtualization platform commonly approved and used in DoD and contractor environments.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- Proper use of virtualization for security testing  
- Safe replication of production-like systems  
- Familiarity with enterprise-grade tooling

---

### Screenshot 2: Linux Operating System Verification

![OS Verification](images/linuxos.png)
**What is shown:**  
Terminal output confirming Linux distribution and version using `/etc/os-release`.

**Why this matters:**  
Accurate OS identification is critical for vulnerability management, patching, and DISA STIG compliance in DoD environments.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- System awareness and configuration validation  
- Compliance-focused mindset  
- Linux administration fundamentals

---

### Screenshot 3: Successful SSH Connectivity

![SSH Access](images/sshlogin.png)

**What is shown:**  
Successful SSH connection from the Server VM to Target system.

**Why this matters:**  
SSH is a primary administrative access method and a common attack vector monitored by SOC teams.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- Secure remote access configuration  
- Understanding of monitored attack surfaces  
- Realistic administrative workflows

---

### Screenshot 4: Logging Services Enabled

![Logging Services](images/logservice.png)

**What is shown:**  
`rsyslog` service running and authentication logs visible on the monitored (Target) system.

**Why this matters:**  
Authentication and system logs are foundational for security monitoring, auditing, and forensic investigations.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- Knowledge of Linux logging architecture  
- Ability to locate and interpret security logs  
- Audit-readiness

---

### Screenshot 5: Failed Authentication Events

![Failed Logins](images/failedssh.png)

**What is shown:**  
Multiple failed SSH login attempts recorded in system logs.

**Why this matters:**  
Repeated authentication failures are a key indicator of brute-force or unauthorized access attempts.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- Controlled generation of security events  
- Awareness of attacker behavior  
- SOC-relevant detection skills

---

### Screenshot 6: Centralized Log Forwarding Configuration

![Log Forwarding](images/moduleconf.png)

**What is shown:**  
`rsyslog` configured to forward logs from the Target system to a centralized logging server (SOC.Server).

**Why this matters:**  
Centralized logging ensures logs remain available and protected even if a system is compromised.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- Centralized security architecture knowledge  
- Understanding of log integrity and availability  
- Enterprise monitoring concepts

---

### Screenshot 7: Log Ingestion on Monitoring System

![Log Ingestion](images/ubuntulogs.png)

**What is shown:**  
Logs from the Target Linux system appearing on the monitoring Server.

**Why this matters:**  
SOC operations depend on reliable telemetry ingestion to detect and investigate incidents.

**What this demonstrates:**  
- End-to-end visibility  
- Verification of data flow  
- SOC troubleshooting capability

---

### Screenshot 8: Log Filtering and Analysis

![Log Analysis](images/failedlogins.png)

**What is shown:**  
Filtered authentication and SSH events displayed on the monitoring Server system.
Repeated authentication failures clustered over time.

**Why this matters:**  
SOC analysts must quickly reduce large volumes of log data into actionable security signals.
Threat detection relies on identifying behavioral patterns & correlated events.

**What this demonstrates:**  

- Log filtering techniques  
- Pattern recognition  
- Analyst-level workflows
- Analytical thinking  
- Understanding of brute-force indicators  
- Threat detection fundamentals
